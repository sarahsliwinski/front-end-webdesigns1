<p class="p1">The Kingston and Arthurs vale Historic Area (KAvHA) is of outstanding significance to the nation as a convict settlement spanning the era of transportation to eastern Australia between 1788 and 1855. </p>
    
<p class="p1">Europeans were not the first people to inhabit Norfolk island. Stone tools found at both Emily and Slaughter Bays within KAvHA indicate that Polynesian settlement of the area occurred between AD 1200 and AD 1600.</p>
    
<p class= "p1"> The area was visited by Captain James Cook RN in 1774, Norfolk island was settled on 6 March 1788, six weeks after the First Fleet landed in Sydney. A settlement was established at Kingston, with crops sown in the adjoining valley, Arthurs vale. To relieve the food pressures in the infant colony of New South Wales, Governor Philip relocated around one-third of Sydney’s population to Kingston.</p>

<p class="p1">Both convicts and free settlers farmed small holdings of land. The  first settlement’s population peaked at 1156 in May 1792. By 1804, the free settlers on the island significantly outnumbered the convicts who represented 23 per cent of the total population of 1084. Abandoned in 1814, the settlement’s buildings were destroyed.
in 1825, the island was re-occupied to provide secondary punishment of convicts. Secondary punishment was designed to revive the fear of transportation and deter crime in Britain and the colonies. it was a sentence applied to transported convicts who re-offended in the colony.</p>
    
<p class="p1">KAvHA developed a reputation as one of the harshest and cruelest of Australia’s penal settlements.

<h2>History</h2>
    
<h3>Early Polynesian Presence</h3>

<p class="p1">Europeans were not the first people to inhabit Norfolk Island. Stone tools have been found at both Emily and Slaughter bays within KAVHA. Archaeological investigations have revealed evidence of landscape modifications in the Emily Bay area including artefact assemblages and structural remains that have been interpreted as a rudimentary marae, a religious structure characteristic of East Polynesian culture. Radiocarbon dating indicates Polynesian settlement of the area occurred between AD 1200 and AD 1600.</p>

<h3>The First European Settlement</h3>

        <p class="p1">Discovered by Captain James Cook RN in 1774, Norfolk Island was settled on 6 March 1788, six weeks after the First Fleet landed in Sydney. Cook reported the island had rich soils, tall pines suitable for ships masts and spars, and native flax that could be used for making canvas. Governor Philip had instructions to settle and secure the island as soon as possible to secure its potential naval supplies.</p>

        <p class="p1">Arriving on the Supply, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King RN and a party of nine male and six female convicts and seven staff established a settlement named Kingston. Crops were sown in the adjoining valley, Arthurs Vale, and, unlike the experience in Sydney, the Kingston crops flourished. To relieve the food pressures in the infant colony of New South Wales, Governor Philip relocated around one-third Sydney's population to Kingston.</p>

        <p class="p1">Extensive clearing followed and both convicts and free settlers farmed small holdings of land. The rising land behind Kingston was cleared for surveillance and to ensure there was no cover for escaping convicts. The first settlement's population peaked at 1156 in May 1792. By 1804 the free settlers on the island significantly outnumbered the convicts who represented 23 percent of the total population of 1084. On its abandonment in 1814 the settlement's buildings were destroyed.</p>

    <h3>The Second Settlement</h3>

        <p class="p1">In response to the report by Commissioner Bigge (1822-23) on the effectiveness of transportation, the Colonial Secretary Lord Bathurst instructed Governor Brisbane in 1824 to re-occupy the island as a 'great hulk or penitentiary' to provide secondary punishment. Secondary punishment was designed to revive the fear of transportation and deter crime in Britain and the colonies, and was a sentence applied to transported convicts who re-offended in the colony.</p>

        <p class="p1">Norfolk Island was re-occupied on 6 June 1825 by Captain Turton as commandant, with a party of 50 soldiers, 57 convicts, six women and six children. The settlement was again located around Kingston and the remains of some first settlement buildings were rebuilt, old agricultural areas rehabilitated and new areas cleared. But it was to be of an entirely different character to the first settlement.</p>

        <p class="p1">The second settlement on Norfolk Island was designed to be the extreme in convict degradation and the came to stand for worst of the transportation system.</p>

    <h3>Hell on earth</h3>

        <p class="p1">Convicts worked from sunrise to sunset. Agricultural work was done with hoes and spades, and no ploughs or working cattle were used. Convict accommodation was cramped and unsanitary and this, combined with their poor diet of one meal every 48 hours, resulted in poor health and many deaths. The harshness and degradation of the treatment metered out to the convicts was intended to break them. Floggings were common, even for trivial offences, and sentences could be extended.</p>

        <p class="p1">The worst of the convict population from both New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land were sent to Norfolk Island; men who had become so brutalised by the system that ever increasing levels of punishment only served to make them more recalcitrant. The prospect of punishment by death was no deterrent.</p>

        <p class="p1">The ruthless men charged with running Norfolk Island and controlling its convict population were themselves part of a brutal system.</p>

        <p class="p1">A number of the commandants, including Captain James Morisset, Major Joseph Childs and John Price, were particularly cruel. Mutinies and uprisings were not uncommon and invariably led to floggings and hangings. It was during Morisset's period as commandant (1829-34), which was noted for his extensive use of the lash, that Norfolk Island became renowned as 'hell on earth' and by 1833 the island's fearsome reputation was well known in Britain.</p>

    <h3>A New Prison Philosophy</h3>

        <p class="p1">Only one commandant of Norfolk Island, Alexander Maconochie, brought a humanising regime of reform to the second settlement period through four of its 30 years. He introduced the Merits System of Penal Discipline, which worked on the principle that the prisoner could secure freedom if they were industrious and well behaved. For a number of reasons, including the fact that his superiors disapproved of his reformist actions, his reforms failed. Under Maconochie's humanitarian influence the conditions for prisoners had improved. They rapidly deteriorated, however, under the next commandant, Major Joseph Childs.</p>

    <h3>The Final Years</h3>

        <p class="p1">The latter stages of the second settlement saw prisoners arriving direct from Britain to serve the first stage of their punishment under the new probation system introduced in 1843. The severity of the place continued and in his report to the British Parliament in 1847, Catholic Bishop Robert Wilson detailed the appalling conditions on Norfolk Island. His report helped bring an end to the island's use as a penal settlement. It was gradually closed between 1847 and 1855 with some convicts having been released on tickets of leave, while others were taken to Port Arthur where they served out their sentences. An Order in Council made on 29 December 1853, repealed all previous orders making Norfolk Island a penal settlement. A small party remained on the island to care for the farms and livestock and to handover to the incoming settlers from Pitcairn Island, who constituted the third settlement phase of the island's history.</p>

    <h3>Third Settlement</h3>

        <p class="p1">As the Pitcairn Island descendents of the Bounty mutineers had outgrown their island home, the British government chose to resettle them on Norfolk Island. The whole Pitcairn community landed at Kingston Pier on 8 June 1856.</p>

        <p class="p1">Their descendents, who today comprise nearly a third of Norfolk Island's population, still speak the Pitcairn language. For them KAVHA is a place of special significance because it has been continually and actively used since their arrival as a place of residence, work, worship and recreation. KAVHA is uncommon as a place where a distinctive Polynesian/European community has lived and practised their cultural traditions for over 150 years.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
    
        <p class="p1">Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area (KAVHA) is situated on the southern side of Norfolk Island fronting Slaughter Bay.</p> 
    
        <p class="p1">Referred to as KAVHA it is a cultural landscape which includes an agrarian landscape (Arthurs Vale, Watermill valley and the northern hillsides) and the settled coastal plain at Kingston. Hills to the north and west fringe the settlement on the coastal plain. Roads provide ways through KAVHA, linking the groups of structures, access to the landing place, the foreshore, the cemetery and bridges. The Kingston plain is Norfolk’s only coastal plain area with beach, dune and a coral edged lagoon.</p> 
    
        <div class="shoreline"><img src="assets/images/shoreline.JPG" alt="view of the shoreline that surrounds the historic area"></div>
 
        <p class="p1">The convict barracks and gaol were located on the foreshore. Swampy land separated the convict accommodation from the military and civil accommodation arranged on the inland side of the coastal flat while a succession of Government houses were positioned in commanding locations. The many surviving buildings at the site reflect these arrangements.</p> 
 
        <p class="p1">The cleared nature of the landscape, along with the siting and orientation of important buildings are an explicit demonstration of the settlement and penal philosophy of the British Empire in colonial Australia, being designed to provide for the continual surveillance of convicts and allow for agricultural requirements. Modification to the landscape through earthworks to facilitate the construction of buildings or protect agricultural plots (the 'causeway') and the large scale quarrying of limestone and the coral reef, illustrate attitudes to landscape based primarily on its value as a resource. Surviving evidence also illustrates aspects of design and process from the First and Second Settlements. This includes the remnant serpentine landscape and ornamental garden of Government House, the formal streetscape qualities of Quality Row, and evidence of communications through maintaining visual links and operation of a semaphore system. Evidence from the Third Settlement period is the introduction of new plant species, swamp drainage works, memorial plantings and reforestation to address erosion on the hill slopes.</p> 
 
        <p class="p1">KAVHA is rare, being the site of, and probably containing extensive archaeological evidence of the earliest European settlement from Australia to the south-west Pacific (1788), similar in size for a decade to the other initial settlement at Sydney Cove. Its significance is enhanced by the lack of substantial subsequent development. It contains areas and individual elements that are confirmed or well documented sites of First Settlement buildings and activities (1788-1814). The subsurface archaeological remains of the first and second Government Houses (1788-1803) are, along with First Government House Sydney (1788-1847), the oldest government house sites in Australia.</p>  

        <p class="p1">The concentration and intactness of fabric is considered rare. The intact layout, form and fabric of the place illustrate the patterns of human occupation, ways of life, and perceptions and values of the landscape, and accumulative impact of Europeans on a pristine natural environment (Australian Construction Services, 1994).</p> 

        <p class="p1">KAVHA is significant for its richness of settlement history and array of extant features. It contains areas, buildings and other elements of outstanding individual cultural significance including Government House (1829), one of the earliest and most intact remaining government house buildings in Australia, along with Old Government House Parramatta, and the Old Military Barracks (now the Legislative Assembly and Norfolk Island Court) (1829). The Old Military Barracks, together with the Commissariat Store and the New Military Barracks (now Norfolk Island Government Administration offices) (1836), form a group of buildings which is the most substantial military barracks complex in Australia dating from the 1830s. The Commissariat Store (now All Saints Church) (1835) is one of the finest remaining colonial (pre 1850) military commissariat stores in Australia along with that at Darlington (Tasmania). The soldiers' barracks is one of the finest military barrack buildings built in Australia in the nineteenth century.</p> 

        <p class="p1">There are nine houses providing quarters for military and civil officers (1832-47). Other features include: perimeter walls and archaeological remains of Prisoners' Barracks (1828-48) including the Protestant Chapel; perimeter walls and archaeological remains of the New Prison (Pentagonal Prison) (1836-40, 1845-57); ruins of the hospital, built on First Settlement remains (1829); the Surgeon's Quarters and Kitchen (1827) on the site of First Settlement Government House, one of the earliest European dwellings in Australia; the Landing Pier (1839-47) built over the First Settlement landing place and sea wall, two of the earliest remaining large scale engineering works in Australia; Beach store (1825); Settlement Guardhouse (1826) on the foundations of First Settlement building; Crankmill (1827-38), the remains of the only known human powered crankmill built in Australia before 1850; Royal Engineer's office and stables (1850); Double Boat Shed (1841); Police Office, now boatshed (1828-29); Flaghouse (1840s); Constable's Quarters, partly standing (1850-53); Blacksmith's Shop (1846); Salt House (1847); and Windmill base (1842-43).</p> 
    
        <p class="p1">The Cemetery has an outstanding collection of headstones and other remains dating from the earliest period of European settlement, including the first and second penal settlement periods and the Pitcairn period with associations with the Bounty, set in an evocative and picturesque historical landscape. Many stone walls, wells, drains, building platforms, bridges, culverts, roads, quarry sites, privies and archaeological sites of former buildings are important remains. These include Bloody Bridge. The remnant serpentine landscape is an outstanding example of colonial period (pre-1850) attitudes to landscape design in Australia which reflected contemporary English attitudes to landscape design.</p>
    
        <div class= "gravestone"><img src="assets/images/gstone1.JPG" alt="Gravestone from 1834"></div>

        <p class="p1">The place is particularly infamous as one of two places of secondary punishment within the Australian colonies (the other being Port Arthur). Its reputation was renowned throughout the British Empire to act as a deterrent to further convict crime in the colonies. It is also associated with an experiment in penal reform in the NSW colony which underpinned modern approaches to penal practice internationally. It has an association with Australia's founding and early personalities such as King, Hunter, Foveaux, Wentworth, Anderson, Maconochie, Price and Cash. It is also associated with the 1790 wreck of HMS Sirius, the flagship of the First Fleet and the only sizable warship available to defend the colony which was about to sail to China to obtain desperately needed food supplies for the colony at Sydney Cove (Australian Construction Services, 1994).</p> 

        <p class="p1">The place is rich in aesthetic qualities due to the combination of spatial structure, visual quality and the strong relationship between built elements and their setting. Apart from visual quality, the places is a rich source of other sensory stimuli; the sounds, tastes and textures are all products of the friction wrought between such natural elements as wind, water and sun. Oceanic influences render the natural lighting of the place very changeable over a day, and dramatise the scene. The combination of cultural expression, natural forces and their resultant patterns enable a perception and interpretation of the place as a 'picturesque' and 'romantic' landscape made up of a number of elements including natural/built edges, sea/landscape vistas, gardens, rural pastures, cleared hills and formal plantings (Australian Construction Services, 1994).</p> 
 
        <p class="p1">The Sirius wreck (1790) remains on the seabed off the reef in Slaughter Bay. The first anchor raised was in 1903. Artefacts have been recovered from the wreck, some of which form part of the collection housed in the Norfolk Island Museum. The artefact collection, in combination with a detailed written record, has outstanding research potential for information about the lives of the bond and free in the early convict period. Other relics, including two of the Sirius anchors are on the mainland. The large anchor is displayed in Macquarie Place, Sydney and another is in the Maritime Museum in Sydney.</p>
 
        <p class="p1">The low-lying land of KAVHA is generally composed of calcarenite, a limestone formed of cemented cross-bedded calcareous sand, the remnants of a formerly much more extensive coral formation (Tropman and Tropman 1994). The dunes behind Emily Bay and Cemetery Beach contain a number of small fossil and sub-fossil deposits of recent age (between 450 and 7 000 years BP). These sites have yielded some fossilised vertebrate bones, remains of several land snail species that are now considered to be extinct or extremely rare, and fossilised seeds and logs of the Norfolk Island Pine (Tropman and Tropman 1994; Anderson and White 2001; DEH 2005). These fossils provide evidence of plant and animal life that existed on Norfolk Island before human occupation.</p> 
 
        <p class="p1">Most of KAVHA has been cleared and the original vegetation severely modified. Tropman and Tropman (1994) describe it as dominated by Kikuyu grass and note that while the sheltered gullies contain some remnant ferns, mixed hardwoods and white oaks, they have been colonised by weed species such as olives and lantana.  KAVHA may still support a small population of a rare landsnail (Mathewsoconcha suteri).</p>

<h2>The Buildings</h2>

    <h3>KAVHA's major buildings include:</h3>
    
        <ul>

            <li>The 1829 Government House, one of the earliest and most intact remaining government house buildings in Australia, with its commanding views of the settlement</li>
        
        <!-- place images for each location and include a navigation link to the information in the CSS-->
        
            <li>The Old Military Barracks and officers quarters constructed between 1829-1834 which are surrounded by high walls giving it an appearance of a military fortress</li>
            <li>The New Military Barracks, commenced in 1836 which follows a similar fortress-like design</li>
            <li>The Commissariat Store, dating from 1835 which is the finest remaining colonial (pre 1850) military commissariat store in Australia</li>
            <li>The elegant Quality Row houses that provided quarters for military and civil officers. To optimise surveillance, the military complexes are elevated in order to oversight the convict precinct located closer to the water and at a lower elevation.</li>
    
        </ul>
    
        <p class="p1">Also to be found at KAVHA are the archaeological remains of the two convict gaols, and the perimeter walls and archaeological remains of the prisoners' barracks (1828-48) with the Protestant chapel. These show the development of penal philosophies during the period of the settlements operation, with the original gaol built for barrack accommodation while the remains of the new prison and its perimeter walls (1836-40, 1845-57) provides a rare representation of a radial design.</p>

        <p class="p1">Other archaeological remains include the blacksmith's shop (1846), lumber yard, water mill, the crankmill (1827-38), the remains of the only known human powered crankmill built in Australia before 1850, the salt house (1847), the windmill base (1842-43), lime kilns; the landing pier (1839-47) and sea wall, two of the earliest remaining large scale engineering works in Australia. The role of religion in reform is evident in the Protestant and Catholic clergyman's quarters.</p>
    
<h2>The Original Buildings</h2>
    
        <h3>The Pier Store</h3>

        <p class="p1">The Pier Store was built in 1825 as a commissariat store. It was built as a secure building because food, clothes and uniforms were stored there. Until about 1840 there was a boatshed attached at the western end.</p>

        <h4>Its uses during the Second Settlement:</h4>
    
        <p class="p1">On 8th May, 1834, the Pier Store (as well as other low lying areas of Kingston) was flooded by a very high tide or tsunami. Because of the damage, the new Commissariat Store was built on Quality Row. At that time the water mill was not able to grind all the grain that was needed so 26 handmills were installed upstairs in the Pier Store. Each of these was operated by two men and men who were unable to do harder work were used on the handmills. The mills only lasted 12 months before they were worn out. The Crankmill then was used for the grinding and the handmills were removed. The top floor of the Pier Store was then used as a guard room so the balcony was installed to give a better view of the area. Downstairs was still used as a store.</p>

        <h4>Its uses during the Third Settlement</h4>
    
        <p class="p1">The Pitcairners used the Pier Store as a customs store and part of the upper floor was used as a coffin room.</p> 

        <h4>Its uses today</h4>
    
        <p class="p1">The Pier Store has been used continuously since it was built in 1825 and became part of the Norfolk Island Museum in 1988. Downstairs you will find the Sirius exhibition. Upstairs is now dedicated to exhibitions about Norfolk Island history since the arrival of the Pitcairners.</p>

    <h3>The Royal Engineer's Office</h3>
    
            <div class="frontengineersoffice"><img src= "assets/images/frontengineersoffice.JPG" alt="Front of the Engineers office on Kingston Street"></div>

        <h4>When was it built?</h4>
   
        <p class="p1">The Royal Engineer’s Office was built in 1850-1851. There was a stable for four horses built behind the Royal Engineer’s Office</p>

        <h4>Its uses during the Second Settlement</h4>

        <p class="p1">The Royal Engineers were responsible for the design of many of the Kingston buildings. They worked with the Foreman of Works to ensure the buildings were built correctly.</p>
    
        <p class="p1">The Royal Engineers also designed the roads, seawall, drainage systems, underground sewers and the pier. The fact that the pier, roads and seawall are still in use today is a proper memorial to the excellence of their work.</p>

        <h4>Its uses during the Third Settlement</h4>
    
        <p class= "p1">The Royal Engineer’s Office was used as a private home and was purchased by the US Consular Agent in the 1890s and the Meade and Adams families lived there. In 1897 it was taken to be the home of a police constable and later became the home of the Signals Master. It was lived in by other families until the 1980s.</p>

        <h4>Its uses today</h4>
    
        <p class= "p1">Today the Royal Engineer’s Office has been restored and is used as the REO Café. The stables are used as the public toilets.</p>
    
        <div class= "engineersoffice"><img src="assets/images/engineersoffice.JPG" alt="Alternative view of the engineers office"></div>

    <h3>Kingston Pier</h3>
    
        <div class="kingstonpier"><img src="assets/images/kingstonpier.jpg" alt="Kingston Pier"></div>
        
        <div class="boatsheds"><img src="assets/images/pierboatsheads.JPG" alt="The Pier Boatsheads on Kindston Pier"></div>
                       
        <h4>When was it built?</h4>
   
        <p class= "p1">Work began on the pier in 1839 under the supervision of the Royal Engineer, Lieutenant Lugard. Building finished in 1849 but it was never completed to its original design. Much of the work was done by convicts who had committed additional offences on Norfolk Island. They often worked up to their waists in seawater, wearing heavy chains weighing up to 16kgs. They quarried rock from underwater and broke it up for use</p>

        <h4>Its uses during the First Settlement</h4>
   
        <p class= "p1">During the First Settlement, landings occurred to the west of the current pier.</p>
 
        <h4>Its uses during the Second Settlement</h4>
   
        <p class="p1">It was built during the Second Settlement to give improved conditions for landing things on the island. Its curved shape was designed to reduce the strength of the waves. As waves hit the pier, they are reflected off at 90o, losing much of their energy.</p>
 
        <h4>Its uses during the Third Settlement</h4>
   
        <p class="p1">The Pitcairners landed on the pier on the 8th June 1856. It continued to be used as the main pier.</p>

        <h4>Its uses today</h4>
    
        <p class="p1">The pier has been repaired regularly but it still is the same size and shape it was when it was completed.</p> 
 
        <p class="p1">The davit on the pier lifts fishing boats in and out of the water.</p>
 
        <p class="p1">It is still used today for landing things that come to Norfolk Island by boat. It is one of the two sites that fishing boats leave from and is also a popular fishing spot for anglers.</p>

    <h3>Commissariat Store</h3>
    
        <div class="barricsandstore"><img src="assets/images/barricsandstore.jpg" alt="view of the commissariat store as well as the barrics"></div>
 
        <h4>Its use during the Second Settlement</h4>
    
        <p class="p1">This building was built to replace the two commissariats that had been near the waterfront, and it was built in 1835. The stores near the pier had been damaged in a big flood and Colonel Anderson knew that he had to keep the stores safe. The building has three storeys, with a basement at ground level.</p> 

        <h4>Its use today</h4>
    
        <p class="p1">The second and lower main floors are now the All Saints Church, the top floor holds archives and the basement is now the Commissariat Store Museum.</p>

        <p class="p1">Many of the items on show are of archaeological interest, showing the four settlements of Norfolk Island, from the Polynesian settlement to the present day and there is much of interest to see.</p> 

        <p class="p1">Norfolk Island has a long and interesting history and we are still finding items that show the way of life that people led. The everyday items that people used in their homes tell the historians a great deal about the way they adapted to life on the island, as they often had to make items that they could not just buy in the shops. The settlers also brought with them many beautiful, precious or useful things that they needed. When they came to the island many of them knew that they would be here for a long time as travel was difficult.</p>  

    <h3>Gaol</h3>

        <h4>Its uses during the First Settlement</h4>
    
        <p class="p1">During the first years of the First Settlement convicts lived in small wooden huts along the seafront and flatlands but later a gaol was needed to house wrongdoers. A stone gaol was built near the shore and is known as The Old Gaol. It was destroyed before the First Settlement was abandoned in 1814.</p>

        <h4>Its uses during the Second Settlement</h4>
    
        <p class="p1">The gaols were only used to house convicts who had committed extra offences on Norfolk Island. Other convicts were housed in prisoners’ barracks. In the late 1820s a small temporary gaol was built over the ruins of the first settlement one. It was still being used in the mid 1840s. The New Gaol was built gradually from 1836 to 1848 starting under Major Anderson. It was a pentagonal prison with 5 wings of cells each with their own exercise yard. Each wing could be supervised from the central building.</p> 
    
        <div class="barricplan"> <img src="assets/images/barricplan.jpg" alt="The original written plan for the Barracks"></div>
 
        <p class="p1">Unfortunately the gaol was terribly overcrowded which made living conditions appalling. Punishments were often very severe and convicts were hanged for serious offences.</p>
 
        <h4>Its uses during the Third Settlement</h4>
    
        <p class="p1">The Pitcairners did not use the gaol as they did not need it. They dismantled parts of it to recycle the stone for use in other buildings.</p>
 
        <h4>Its uses today</h4>
    
        <p class="p1">The Old Gaol is a ruin with only a few rocks visible on the land on the beachfront. The New Gaol is a ruin but parts of the complex are now used for performances.</p>

    <h3>Longridge</h3>

        <h4>Its uses during the Second Settlement</h4>
    
        <p class="p1">Planning for a major building program in the Longridge area began in 1839. The main purpose of Longridge was as an agricultural settlement with the prisoners providing the labour for the farms. A wooden Barracks made up of three buildings was built there under Captain Maconochie as a separate prison to accommodate newly arrived convicts. All together they held 167 prisoners. There were also all the buildings needed for the large agricultural activities carried out there and numbered around 35. Some families lived at Longridge. Among them was the family of Gilbert Robertson, the Superintendant of Agriculture from 1845. His daughter, Elizabeth wrote a detailed diary about her life there until her death in 1847 which gives detail on the way of life at Longridge. See Elizabeth Robertson’s Diary Norfolk Island 1845 (ed Merval Hoare).</p>
 
        <h4>Its uses during the Third Settlement</h4>
    
        <p class="p1">When the Pitcairners moved to Norfolk Island from Pitcairn Island in 1856, some of them lived in buildings at Longridge. Members of the Nobbs family lived in what is now Branka House until World War II.</p>
 
        <h4>Its uses today</h4>
    
        <p class="p1">Much of the Longridge area is now used for farming and houses have been built in the area. The Arches remain from the Second Settlement buildings at Longridge. Unfortunately its use and history are unknown.</p>
